# RDT-Prediction-Tweet-Market
Python script that tracks @realDonaldTrumpâ€™s tweet market on predictit.com, it reports to slack if negative risk is available and checks the best buy price available on both YES and NO sides of the market


#### MARKET ID's probably need to be updated, you need your own slack api key
